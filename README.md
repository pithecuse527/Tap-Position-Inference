# Tap Position Inference

Inference the tap position of the mobile devices.

## Description

The demo app was developed with Flutter. 
It simply save the snapshot of the 12-tapping zone's information. (Gyroscope, Accelerometer and Tapped Position Coordinate)
The app will also send those collected snapshot data to Firestore.

By using those colledted data, we can build our inference model with Tensorflow.
You may see how it actually works on the inference.ipynb file.
